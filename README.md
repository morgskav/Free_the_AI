# Free the AI
Let's bring open-source AI to the ZHAW—local, private, secure, flexible, and entirely our own. 



# 🐉 The IMK Model Menagerie: A Curated Experience Space, Research Platform, Development Arena and Strategic Showcase

>**"Putting the L back in LLM - Language Matters because AI implementation is a communicative act"**

The IMK Model Menagerie disrupts the business model driving the replacement of human experts and communicators with AI solutions. With the managerie, we can show how much language matters and how language experts can enable domain experts to take a leading role in shaping, developing, and deploying AI systems. We empower experts to curate domain-specific AI models, conduct research on them, and take full ownership of their implementation—all open-source and local.

### What is the IMK Model Menagerie?

The IMK Model Menagerie is a collection of state-of-the-art, open-source, locally run, data protection compliant, transparent, configurable, fine-tuneable, and scalable AI models—both large and small.

It functions as a:
- **Research platform** for exploring the role of language professionals and domain experts in AI implementation.
- **Experience space** for students, lecturers and researchers to engage hands-on with a variety of models in a fully open and flexible way.
- **Showcase** for demonstrating the impact of expertise on the effectiveness and efficiency of AI implementation.

### Why It Matters

In contrast to opaque, corporate-controlled AI, the Menagerie is:
- **Local** – secure, data protection compliant, and ethically and environmentally responsible.
- **Efficient** – even small-scale, locally operated models can be made useful.
- **Transparent** – model architecture, training data, and use cases are fully documented and open.
- **Cost-effective** – open-source models eliminates reliance on costly licenses or external vendors.
- **Curated** – we can adapted interfaces, adjust all settings and fine-tuned models to meet specific research questions or experiece goals.
- **Ours** – from interface, model parameters to implementation concept and compute, everything is built, owned, and operated by us.

### Empowering Linguists, Communication Experts and Domain Professionals

The Menagerie is more than a tool—it’s a **transformation concept**. It allows us to research, develop and demonstrate methods for language experts in collaboration with domain experts to meaningfully contribute to every stage of AI implementation. Open research questions are:

- **Problem Assessment**: In what settings are AI solutions appropriate. 
- **Model Selection**: Which models best suit a particular setting?
- **Model Configuration**: How do prompt design, temperature, and sampling settings affect the usefulness of a particular model in a particular setting?
- **Data Curation**: How do we select and evaluate examples for prompts or fine-tuning?
- **Evaluation**: How do we measure quality, usefulness and efficiency?

### A Vision for the Future

Our students and researchers can train, deploy, and manage their own AI models. We are not blind consumers—we are **informed researchers and developers** of AI implementations. In doing so, we:
- Increase the value of our education offerings.
- Open new career paths for all domain areas by laying claim to their role in AI implementation.

>**"We embody communication and professional expertise—augmented by AI that we shape and master."**

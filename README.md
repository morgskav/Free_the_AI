## 🐉 The IMK Model Menagerie: A Curated Experience Space, Research Platform, and Strategic Showcase

>**"Putting the L back in LLM - Language Matters because AI implementation is a communicative act"**

The IMK Model Menagerie is part of a strategic initiative that challenges the narrative that AI will replace professionals. With the managerie, we can show how trained linguists and communication experts in collaboration with domain experts can take a leading role in shaping, developing, and deploying AI systems. By combining technical understanding with linguistic expertise, we empower professionals to curate domain-specific AI models, evaluate their impact, and help define entirely new career paths.

### What Is the IMK Model Menagerie?

The IMK Model Menagerie is a collection of state-of-the-art, open-source, locally run, data protection compliant, transparent, configurable, fine-tuneable, and scalable AI models—both large and small.

It functions as a:
- **Research platform** for exploring the role of language professionals in AI implementation.
- **Experience space** for students, lecturers and researchers to engage hands-on with a variety of models and design their own interaction interfaces.
- **Showcase** for demonstrating the impact of language expertiese on the effectiveness and efficiency of AI implementation.

With the Menagerie, we highlight the crucial value of language professionals—and lay claim to entirely new professional roles, such as:
- *Head of AI Implementation for Multilingual Communication*
- *AI Multilingual Communication Systems Integrator*
- *AI Solutions Architect for Multilingual Communication*



### Why It Matters

In contrast to opaque, corporate-controlled AI, the Menagerie is:
- **Local** – secure, data protection compliant, and ethically and environmentally responsible.
- **Efficient** – even small-scale, locally operated models can solve many language tasks excellently.
- **Transparent** – model architecture, training data, and use cases are fully documented and open.
- **Cost-effective** – open-source models reduce reliance on costly licenses or external vendors.
- **Curated** – we can adapted, fine-tuned, or meet specific research questions or experiece goals.
- **Ours** – from interface to model parameters, everything is built, owned, and operated by us.



### Empowering Linguists and Communication Experts and domain professionals

The Menagerie is more than a tool—it’s a **learning and transformation platform**. It allows us to demonstrate how language professionals can meaningfully contribute to every stage of AI implementation:

- **Problem Assessment**: Is an AI solution appropriate. If so, which model is the best fit?
- **Model Selection**: Which models best suit a particular communication task or domain?
- **Model Configuration**: How do prompt design, temperature, and sampling settings affect performance?
- **Data Curation**: How do we select and evaluate examples for prompts or fine-tuning?
- **Evaluation**: What does a “good” output look like, and how do we measure usefulness and efficiency?



### A Vision for the Future

The Menagerie is also a proof of concept: our students and researchers can train, deploy, and manage their own AI models. We are not passive users of corporate AI—we are **active participants and designers** of linguistic AI systems. In doing so, we:
- Increase the value of linguistic education.
- Open new career paths in AI implementation.
- Showcase the strategic role of language expertise in shaping technology.

>**"We embody communication and professional expertise–-enhanced by AI that we shape and master with our expertise."**
